:description: The browser module for ONgDB Server.


[[bundled-neo4j]]
= ONgDB Server

ONgDB is the worldâ€™s leading graph database.
The architecture is designed for optimal management, storage, and traversal of nodes and relationships.
There are two editions of ONgDB to choose from, the Community Edition and the Enterprise Edition.
The Enterprise Edition includes all that Community Edition has to offer, plus extra enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover capabilities.

ONgDB includes a web server that can host different HTTP modules.
If you are using the default configuration, the web server will be started and host the `BROWSER` module (ONgDB Browser) at port `7474` when you start ONgDB.
The `BROWSER` module is available in Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to host ONgDB Browser when you start ONgDB, remove `BROWSER` from the comma-separated list of the configuration setting https://docs.graphfoundation.org/operations-manual/current/configuration/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.http_enabled_modules[dbms.http_enabled_modules^].

.Start ONgDB

Prerequisites for this example:

* Install the ONgDB linux tarball.

[NOTE]
====
New versions of ONgDB Browser are released independently of ONgDB Server.
The Browser version bundled with ONgDB Server is the latest at the time of the ONgDB Server release.
Consequently, when used with a ONgDB server, the Browser version may not be the latest one, and new Browser functionality may not be immediately available.
If you cannot wait for the next release of ONgDB Server and access to the latest version of Browser, refer to the other deployment options below.
Additionally, you can always find the latest version of ONgDB Browser at link:https://browser.ongdb.com/[_https://browser.ongdb.com/_^].
