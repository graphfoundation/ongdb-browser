*ONgDB Browser*

ONgDB Browser is a developer-focused tool that allows you to execute Geequel queries and visualize the results.
It is the default developer interface for both Enterprise and Community editions of ONgDB.
It comes out-of-the-box with all of ONgDBâ€™s graph database offerings, including ONgDB Server (Community and Enterprise editions), ONgDB Cloud (ONgDB's Database as a Service), and ONgDB Desktop (all OS versions).

ONgDB Browser is suitable for running ad-hoc graph queries, with the appropriate ability to prototype a Neo4j-based application.

ONgDB Browser is a tool for developers to interact with the graph, with the main focus on:

* Writing and running graph queries with Cypher.
* Exportable, tabular results of any query result.
* Used for graph visualization of query results containing nodes and relationships.
