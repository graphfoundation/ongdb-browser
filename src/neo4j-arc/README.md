# Neo4j Arc - Browser Component Library

This project currently contains all the components in common between Neo4j Browser and NX. Arc is a recursive backronym for Arc React Components.

## Development

Currently the only supported action for Arc is building it, a dev env & tests to come. To build arc, simply run `yarn build` in this directory, no other steps needed.
